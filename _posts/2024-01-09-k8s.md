# Learning Notes on Kubernetes

## TL;DR  
 Don't learn k8s, it will be outdated eventually.
## Introduction to Kubernetes

In this blog post, I will share my learning notes on Kubernetes, an open-source container orchestration platform.

## Chapter 1: Key Concepts

### Pods

A pod is the smallest unit of deployment in Kubernetes. It represents a single instance of a running process in a cluster.

### Deployments

Deployments are used to manage the lifecycle of pods. They provide declarative updates for pods and ensure that the desired state is maintained.

### Services

Services enable communication between different pods and external clients. They provide a stable network endpoint for accessing the pods.

## Chapter 2: Getting Started with Kubernetes

To get started with Kubernetes, you need to set up a cluster. There are various ways to do this, including using managed Kubernetes services like Amazon EKS or Google Kubernetes Engine.

Once you have a cluster set up, you can start deploying your applications using Kubernetes manifests. These manifests define the desired state of your application, including the number of replicas, resource requirements, and networking configurations.

I hope you find these learning notes helpful in your journey to mastering Kubernetes!
